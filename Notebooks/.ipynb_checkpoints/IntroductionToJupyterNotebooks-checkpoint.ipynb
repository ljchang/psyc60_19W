    "Jupyter notebooks are a great way to have your code and programs then have results showup inline in a web browser. Work for this class will be done in Jupyter notebooks so you can reference what you have done, see the results and someone else could redo it in the future, similar to a typical lab notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than writing and re-writing an entire program, you can write lines of code and run them one at a time. Then, if you need to make a change, you can go back and make your edit and rerun the program again, all in the same window. In our specific case, we are going to use [jupyterhub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) which lets several people access the same computer and data at the same time through a web browser. \n",
